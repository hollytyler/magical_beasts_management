Brief 
A veterinary practice has approached you to build a web application to help them manage their animals and vets. A vet may look after many animals at a time. An animal is registered with only one vet.
- I took a magical spin on mine

MVP 
The practice wants to be able to register / track animals. Important information for the vets to know is -
- Name
- Date Of Birth (use a VARCHAR initially)
- Type of animal
- Contact details for the owner
- Treatment notes
- Be able to assign animals to vets
- CRUD actions for vets / animals - remember the user - what would they want to see on each View? What Views should there be?
