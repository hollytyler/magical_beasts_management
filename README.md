Brief 
A veterinary practice has approached you to build a web application to help them manage their animals and vets. A vet may look after many animals at a time. An animal is registered with only one vet.
- I took a magical spin on mine

MVP 
The practice wants to be able to register / track animals. Important information for the vets to know is -
- Name
- Date Of Birth (use a VARCHAR initially)
- Type of animal
- Contact details for the owner
- Treatment notes
- Be able to assign animals to vets
- CRUD actions for vets / animals - remember the user - what would they want to see on each View? What Views should there be?

To Run this application make a copy of the repository to your local machine. Open the file and ensure you have installed Flask with the command in the terminal pip install flask. Once installed type flask run in your terminal and open it on localhost port 4999.
